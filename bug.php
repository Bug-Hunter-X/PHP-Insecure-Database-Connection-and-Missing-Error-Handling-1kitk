This code suffers from a potential issue related to the usage of the `mysql_*` functions.  The `mysql_connect()` function is deprecated and insecure.  It's vulnerable to SQL injection if user-supplied data is used directly in queries.  Additionally, error handling is missing. If the database connection fails, the script will likely crash without providing any meaningful information.
